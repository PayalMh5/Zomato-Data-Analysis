# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing data from Zomato to gain insights into various trends and patterns. The analysis is performed using Python and several key libraries that facilitate data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Libraries Used

1. **Numpy**: Efficiently handles complex computations and large calculations with Numpy arrays.
2. **Matplotlib**: Offers a wide range of features for creating high-quality plots, charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more.
3. **Pandas**: Simplifies loading data frames into 2D arrays and provides functions for performing multiple analysis tasks in a single operation.
4. **Seaborn**: Provides a high-level interface for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics.

## Tools

You can use Google Colab Notebook or Jupyter Notebook to simplify your task.

## Analysis Objectives

To address our analysis, we need to respond to the following inquiries:

1. **Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?**
2. **Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?**
3. **What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?**

## Setup and Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Running the Analysis

1. **Load the data**: Import your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data as needed.

3. **Analysis and Visualization**:
    - Use `Numpy` for any complex calculations.
    - Use `Pandas` to manipulate and analyze the data.
    - Use `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.

### Example Code

Below is an example of how to load the data and create a simple count plot:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('zomato_data.csv')  # Replace with your actual data file

# Check if a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery
sns.countplot(x=data['online_order'])
plt.title('Online Order Distribution')
plt.show()

```

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide insights into restaurant trends based on Zomato data. By using Python and its powerful libraries, we can perform efficient data analysis and create informative visualizations to address our key questions.
